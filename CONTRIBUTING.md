- Update README.md for API changes
- Add comments to all exported types
- Keep doc comments clear and concise

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Reports

- Use GitHub Issues
- Include minimal reproduction code
- Describe expected vs actual behavior
- Include Go version and OS

### Feature Requests

- Open an issue for discussion first
- Explain the use case
- Consider backwards compatibility

### Code Contributions

All contributions should:
- Include comprehensive tests
- Pass linter checks
- Maintain existing code style

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Test additions/changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## Release Process

### Automated Releases

This project uses automated release versioning. To create a release:

1. Go to Actions → Release → Run workflow
2. Leave "Version override" empty for automatic version inference
3. Click "Run workflow"

The system will:
- Automatically determine the next version from conventional commits
- Create a git tag
- Generate release notes via GoReleaser
- Publish the release to GitHub

### Commit Conventions for Versioning
- `feat:` new features (minor version: 1.2.0 → 1.3.0)
- `fix:` bug fixes (patch version: 1.2.0 → 1.2.1)
- `feat!:` breaking changes (major version: 1.2.0 → 2.0.0)
- `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:` no version change

Example: `feat(worker): add configurable buffer size`

### Version Preview on Pull Requests
Every PR automatically shows the next version that will be created:
- Check PR comments for "Version Preview"
- Updates automatically as you add commits
- Helps verify your commits have the intended effect

## Questions?

- Open an issue for questions
- Check existing issues first
- Be patient and respectful
